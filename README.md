enjoyllk2
=========

enjoyllk2 v1.0, my 3rd Android game, using SDL2.0.1

Note: SDL2 supports mingw (see jni/SDL2-2.0.1/Makefile) & android (using ndk-build under this path), I usually build it with MINGW first, but my MINGW may be too old.  
!!!!!NOTE!!!!!: This game is not able to be uploaded to some Android markets (gfan and appchina) for homogenization (similar to many applications in market). It is ONLY a demo for my SDL2 game study.
